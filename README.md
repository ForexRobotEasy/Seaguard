## Overview

The Seaguard Expert Advisor is designed to automate trading in the MetaTrader 5 platform. It uses a predefined risk percentage per trade to calculate the position size and opens a long position when there are no open positions. If the current position becomes profitable, it sets a trailing stop to protect profits.

## Input Parameters

- RiskPercentage: The risk percentage per trade. Default value is set to 2.0.

## Global Variables

- ticket: Order ticket number. Initialized as 0.

## Functions

### OnInit()

This function is called during the Expert Advisor initialization process. It sets the trading parameters, such as the contract size, and returns INIT_SUCCEEDED.

### OnDeinit(const int reason)

This function is called during the Expert Advisor deinitialization process. It closes any open orders before shutting down the Expert Advisor.

### OnTick()

This function is called on every tick of the market. It checks if there are any open positions. If there are no open positions, it calculates the position size based on the risk percentage and opens a long position with a predefined stop loss and take profit levels. If there is an open position and it becomes profitable, it sets a trailing stop to protect profits.

### Custom Functions

#### MagicNumber()

This function returns a magic number, which is used to identify the orders opened by the Expert Advisor. Replace the return value with your own magic number.
